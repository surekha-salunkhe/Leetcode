Step 1: Core Prerequisites

ðŸ”¹ Data Structures

Arrays & Strings
Linked Lists (singly, doubly)
Stacks & Queues (and Deque)
HashMap / HashSet (Dictionary in Python, Map/Set in Java)
Trees (binary, BST, n-ary) + traversals
Graphs (adjacency list/matrix, directed/undirected)
Heaps / PriorityQueue
Trie
Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

ðŸ”¹ Algorithms

Sorting (quick, merge, heap, counting sort basics)
Searching (binary search + variations)
Recursion & Backtracking
Greedy algorithms
Dynamic Programming (memoization, tabulation)
Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS
Dijkstra
Bellman-Ford
Floyd-Warshall
Topological Sort
Divide and Conquer
Bit Manipulation

ðŸ”¹ Math / Misc

Modular arithmetic
GCD/LCM (Euclidean algorithm)
Probability basics (optional but useful)
Prefix sum, difference array
Two-pointer technique

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Problem-Solving Patterns

Almost every LeetCode problem falls into one of these 20â€“25 patterns. 
Master these patterns instead of solving random problems:

Two Pointers (slow/fast, left/right)
Sliding Window
Binary Search (on array, on answer space)
Prefix Sum & Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm
Hashing for lookup / frequency
Monotonic Stack / Queue
Heap / Priority Queue
Recursion / Backtracking (subsets, permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku)
Dynamic Programming
1D (Fibonacci, climbing stairs)
2D (knapsack, matrix path)
DP with state compression
DP on trees & graphs
Greedy (intervals, scheduling, coin change variants)
Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS, union-find, topological sort)
Shortest Path (Dijkstra, BFS for unweighted)
Binary Trees (traversals, diameter, LCA)
Tries (prefix tree)
Bitmasking
Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (later stage)
Math-heavy (primes, modular arithmetic, combinatorics)
Design problems (LRU cache, rate limiter, etc.)
