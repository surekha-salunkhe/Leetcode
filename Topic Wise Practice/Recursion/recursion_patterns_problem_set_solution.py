## Part 1: Basic Printing

# ### Problem 1: Print 1 to N
# # Write a recursive function that prints numbers from 1 to n, each on a new line.
# def recur(n):
#     if n == 0:
#         return
    
#     recur(n - 1)
#     print(n)

# recur(5)

### Problem 2: Print N to 1
#Write a recursive function that prints numbers from n down to 1.
