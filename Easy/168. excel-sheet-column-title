Topics: Math, String

Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.
For example:
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
 
Example 1:
Input: columnNumber = 1
Output: "A"

Example 2:
Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"

Example 3:
Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"

Constraints:
1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My solution:
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        title = ''
        while columnNumber > 0:
            columnNumber -= 1
            title = chr(columnNumber % 26 + ord('A')) + title
            columnNumber //= 26
        return title
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complexity: O(log(N)) 
Time : the value of columnNumber is divided by 26 (columnNumber //= 26), which reduces the problem size logarithmically.
Number of Iterations: The number of iterations is approximately O(log_26(columnNumber)), 
which simplifies to O(log(columnNumber)) since the base of the logarithm is constant.

Space: length of the resulting string is proportional to the number of iterations of the loop, which is O(log(columnNumber)).
