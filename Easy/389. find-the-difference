Topics: Hashtable, string, bit manipulation, sorting

You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

My Solution:
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        for i in t:
            if t.count(i) != s.count(i):
                return i
                
        # same char if removed will leave the different char
        # XOR operation : a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a
        
        # result = 0
        # for char in s:
        #     result ^= ord(char)
        # for char in t:
        #     result ^= ord(char)
        # return chr(result)
